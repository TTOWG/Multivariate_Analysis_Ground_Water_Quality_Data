This project conducts multivariate data analysis of the physiochemical parameters of groundwater samples obtained from boreholes and hand-dug wells around a dumpsite in Lagos, Nigeria. The analysis features exploratory discriptive analysis (EDA), correlation analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) as well as hierarchical cluster analysis. The objective of the process is to assess the mode of association between the parameters and to establish possible sources of groundwater contamination.
